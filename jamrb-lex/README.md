jamrb-lex
=========

Tokenizes ruby code into Racket style S-Expressions.  This will rely heavily on [`ripper_sx`](https://github.com/jmcdonald-ut/jamrb-sx) for testing.  The ultimate plan is to test the output from this against Racket S-Expressified [Ripper](http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.0.0/libdoc/ripper/rdoc/Ripper.html) output.  The plan is to target ruby 2.2.0.
