jamrb-sx
========

Utility for converting between Racket style S-Expressions and
[Ripper](http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.0.0/libdoc/ripper/rdoc/Ripper.html) output.  This is
primarily to help ensure the soundness of output from `jamrb-lex` and `jamrb-parse`.

An auxillary function is also to pretty print Racket style S-Expressions.
